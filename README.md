#### Why code? 👩🏻‍💻
Writing code is an art form. I love how there are multiple solutions to a problem and how dynamic it is. Most importantly, *the learning never stops*. For some, this sounds like a nightmare, but this is what makes coding enjoyable for me; the constant need to keep on your toes and continue learning. My journey into tech began when I decided to do Harvard’s CS50 after speaking to a senior in tech who encouraged me to explore the industry. I had always thought that coding was something that I would dislike and fail to do. I couldn’t have been more wrong. I fell in love, declared a second major in tech, and began exploring the different fields ranging from data science to web development.
#### Web dev 🕸
In school, I took data oriented modules like introduction to AI, data management and social analytics. I enjoyed all of these modules immensely, and can proudly say that I’ve walked away with some data analytics skills. Instead of focusing solely on data, I took modules like web development (PHP) and data management (SQL). I realised that software development was something that I really enjoyed, and something I could see myself doing in the long run.Fast foward to today, I'm a backend developer trainee at foodpanda, and the journey so far has been nothing short of exciting.
