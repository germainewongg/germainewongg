#### Why code? 👩🏻‍💻
Writing code is an art form. I love how there are multiple solutions to a problem and how dynamic it is. Most importantly, **the learning never stops**. For some, this sounds like a nightmare, but this is what makes coding enjoyable for me; the constant need to keep on your toes and continue learning. My journey to tech began unremarkably on a sweltering hot day in 2020 June. It was mid pandemic, everyone was in panic mode, and I had nothing to do at home during the summer break. Instead of twiddling my thumbs, I decided to do Harvard's CS50 after speaking to a senior in tech who encouraged me to explore the industry. I had always thought that coding was something that I would dislike and fail to do. I couldn't have been more wrong. I fell in love, declared a second major in tech, and began exploring the different fields ranging from data science to web development. 
#### Web dev 🕸
In school, I took data oriented modules like introduction to AI, data management and social analytics. I enjoyed all of these modules immensely, and can proudly say that I've walked away with some data analysis skills. Instead of focusing solely on data, I took modules like web development (PHP) and data management (SQL). I realised that web pages were what we interacted with on a daily basis online, and I wanted a hand in building these pages. Besides, I really enjoyed seeing a project come to life as I was building it, and the ability to play around with the design and style was an added bonus. Fast forward to today, I've graduated from Le Wagon's 9 week web development bootcamp, and I've never been more excited to continue learning in my journey into tech.
